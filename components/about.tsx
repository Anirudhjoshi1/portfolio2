  <span className="italic">problem-solving and creative aspects</span> of coding. From integrating complex authentication systems to deploying apps using{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">PM2</span>, I thrive on turning ideas into robust digital experiences.

<p className="mb-3">
  My core stack is{" "}
  <span className="font-medium">React, Node.js, and MongoDB</span>. I am also familiar with{" "}
